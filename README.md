# bullet-hell-demo
A demo of a very basic bullet hell engine.

Note that this is *far* from polished. Functionally, it's engine itself is pretty complete (there are a few minor bugs) but there's no proper scripting or user interface for a demo - in its current state, this is *only* the engine.

I intend to go back and implement a script and UI for a proper showcase of the engine itself, but school is starting soon and I doubt it will be finished soon. Pretty much all of the notable elements (collision detection algorithms, rendering via OpenGL libraries, etc) are implemented.

Note that the "build" folder contains the executable file for the demo along with the required texture files to run.
